# amazon_webscraping
A simple web-scraping project to extract reviews of a amazon product. 
/n
The ipynb file contains the code. link (https://github.com/AbhijeetCodes/amazon_webscraping/blob/master/web%20scraping%20-%20one%20plus%20nord%20reviews.ipynb)
/n
I have also attached the output file & the HTML url of the webpage we extracted, so that incase the page gets changed in future, the code can still be used over it.
